core_app.py is still in development. It lists all the formats of YouTube videos from the search results and is built using Tkinter, YouTube modules, and VLC. Currently, it faces an issue where it fetches the video and audio separately but cannot combine them during playback. Additionally, the audio feature and download function are working properly.

musicapp.py is fully functional. It only shows the highest bitrate audio for playback, and the download option works as well.

vlc_finder is included because, before creating a build, we need certain modules to convert core_app.py and musicapp.py to .exe files. Thatâ€™s why it has also been added to the repository.
